How to build your own jQuery Mobile CSS and JS files
===================================
Clone this repo and build the js and css files (you'll need Git and Make installed):

    make

A full version and a minified version of the jQuery Mobile JavaScript and CSS files will be created 
in a folder named "compiled".

Running the jQuery Mobile demos & docs locally
===================================
To preview locally, you'll need to clone a local copy of this repository and point your Apache & PHP webserver at its 
root directory (a webserver is required, as PHP and .htaccess are used for combining development files).

If you don't currently have a webserver running locally, there are a few options. 

If you're on a Mac, you can try dropping jQuery Mobile into your sites folder and turning on Web Sharing via System 
Prefs. From there, you'll find a URL where you can browse folders in your sites directory from a browser.

Another quick way to get up and running is to download and install MAMP for Mac OSX. Once installed, just open MAMP, 
click preferences, go to the Apache tab, and select your local jQuery Mobile folder as the root. Then you can open a 
browser to http://localhost:8888 to preview the code.

Another alternative is XAMPP (Mac, Windows). You need to actually modify Apache's httpd.conf to point to your checkout:
[Instructions](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html)

You need the following Apache modules loaded:

* Rewrite (mod\_rewrite.so)
* Expire (mod\_expires.so)
* Header (mod\_headers.so)
