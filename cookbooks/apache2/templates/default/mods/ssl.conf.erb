# Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG):
# Configure one or more sources to seed the PRNG of the SSL library.
# The seed data should be of good random quality.
# WARNING! On some platforms /dev/random blocks if not enough entropy
# is available. This means you then cannot use the /dev/random device
# because it would lead to very long connection times (as long as
# it requires to make more entropy available). But usually those
# platforms additionally provide a /dev/urandom device which doesn't
# block. So, if available, use this one instead. Read the mod_ssl User
# Manual for more details.

#   Pass Phrase Dialog:
#   Configure the pass phrase gathering process.
#   The filtering dialog program (`builtin' is a internal
#   terminal dialog) has to provide the pass phrase on stdout.

#   enable only secure ciphers:

#   Use this instead if you want to allow cipher upgrades via SGC facility.
#   In this case you also have to use something like 
#        SSLRequire %{SSL_CIPHER_USEKEYSIZE} >= 128
#   see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/ssl/ssl_howto.html.en#upgradeenc

# enable only secure protocols: SSLv3 and TLSv1, but not SSLv2
