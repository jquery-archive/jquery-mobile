      	<h2>Responsive Web Design (RWD) Basics</h2>
		<p>Creating responsive layouts is pretty easy, but there are a few key things to keep in mind to do this efficiently.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Create a style override stylesheet and include it after the jQuery Mobile framework stylesheet.</strong> This will hold all your custom styles, tweaks to the default widgets and media queries.</li>
			<li><strong>Start by writing the styles you want to see at the narrowest screen width (i.e. "mobile first").</strong> These should be outside a media query. This mobile-first approach is efficient because you can lay down the core typography, colors and styles for mobile knowing that these tend to also be used for wider breakpoints.</li>
			<li><strong>Choose the breakpoints based on your content, not a specific device.</strong> Since there are devices of every imaginable width, it's smarter to choose breakpoints based on how your <em>content</em> looks in your design system. As you re-size the window to wider widths, identify where your content hits a point where it could adapt to take advantage of a wider width.</li>
			<li><strong>Write media queries widths in ems, not pixels.</strong> This ensures the layout will adapt to font size changes in addition to screen widths. To calculate the width in ems, divide the target breakpoint in pixels (320px) by 16px (the default font size) to get the em-based width (20em). </li>
			<li><strong>Use <code>min-width</code> breakpoints that built on top of the mobile styles.</strong> The first breakpoint applies layout adjustments on top of the standard mobile styles so these can be fairly lightweight. Additional <code>min-width</code> breakpoints can be added for even wider screens that each build on the previous breakpoint styles.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Build additional breakpoints on top of each other at increasingly wider widths.</strong> This means that the next breakpoint can add additional styles that build on top of the basic styles and those in the first breakpoint.</li>
			<li><strong>To override framework styles only for smaller screens, use a <code>max-width</code> breakpoint instead.</strong>  This allows you to constrain your style overrides to only apply below a certain screen width. Above this width, all the normal styles will apply so this is good for certain types of overrides.</li>
		</ul>
      
		<h2>Putting it together</h2>
		<p>Here is a simple skeleton of a mobile-first stylesheet that starts with mobile first styles, then builds up a responsive layout by adding two breakpoints:</p>
<pre><code>
<strong>/* Start with basic styles that apply to mobile: typography, stacked elements */
</strong>body { font-family: Helvetica, san-serif; }
H1 { color: green; }
a:link { color:purple; }
.main { display:block; }
.sidebar { display:block; width:100%; }

<strong>/* First breakpoint at 576px: inherits mobile styles, but floats containers to make columns */	
</strong>@media all and (min-width: 36em){
	.main { float: left; width:60%; }
	.sidebar { float: left; width:40%; }
}
<strong>/* Second breakpoint at 800px: inherits everything below, just adjusts column proportions */	
</strong>@media all and (min-width: 50em){
	.main { width:70%; }
	.sidebar { width:30%; }
}
</code></pre>
