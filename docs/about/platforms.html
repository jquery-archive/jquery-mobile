				<h2>Supported platforms in Beta 1</h2>

<p>jQuery Mobile is the most broadly compatible HTML5 library for building web sites and apps and we've very proud of our commitment to accessibility, universal access, and staying true to the principles of the web. For anyone who needs to reach the greatest number of people worldwide, our broad support for all popular platforms is a distinct advantage.In Beta 1, we've added support for both Blackberry 5 devices and Opera Mini in Beta 1 which dramatically increases the reach of the framework. Both of these platforms had issues with handling the Ajax-based navigation so they receive a B grade experience with all the enhancements <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2011/05/27/jquery-mobile-team-update-week-of-may-23/">except for Ajax navigation</a>.</p>

<p>At this stage, jQuery Mobile works on the vast majority of all modern desktop, smartphone, tablet, and e-reader platforms. In addition, feature phones and older browsers are also supported because of our progressive enhancement approach. The only notable platform still in the works is Nokia’s Symbian S60 platform and we have this targeted for Beta 2.</p>

<p>Our <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/">graded support matrix</a> was created over a year ago based on our goals as a project. Since that time, we've been refining our grading system based on real-world device testing and the quickly evolving mobile landscape. To provide a quick summary of our browser support in Beta 1, we've created a simple A (full), B (full minus Ajax), C (basic) grade system with notes of the actual devices and versions we've been testing on in our lab.</p>

<p>The visual fidelity of the experience is highly dependent on CSS rendering capabilities of the device and platform so not all A grade experience will be pixel-perfect but that’s the nature of the web. We’ll be adding additional vendor-prefixed CSS rules to bring transitions, gradients and other visual improvements to non-WebKit browsers in future releases so look for even more added visual polish as we move towards 1.0.</p>

</ul>
				
				
				<p>Since jQuery Mobile is built on the jQuery core, all pages should also work great on most recent versions of desktop browsers too - Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Opera, etc.</p>
